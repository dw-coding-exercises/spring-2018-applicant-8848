# Election Finder
## Summary
This application has been made to work with a native javascript front end, based on bootstrap and ES5. The base clojure framework with hiccup has been modified to produce an HTML page with an MVP approach to development.

### About the author
This is my first clojure project ever. In preparation, I have investigated clojure best practices, style guides and in preparation for the project I spent a good deal of time planning the project before executing it. While the overall assembly of this project did not take a long time (approx 3.5 hours), the research involved took up more time. This is what would normally put in for any project as planning and research is one of my strengths.

This is most likely not the most sophisticated clojure set up, but I hope that this shows my level of documentation, fore-thought and overall preparation standards for any project.

### Lessons Learned
The number one challenge was re-learning some aspects of functional programming. Coming from the OOP/MVC/MOVE world, learning a new system was great fun and I really loved it. I have to admin to missing webpack a little, and some other linting. :)

I also found that the test suite in this setup was not as robust as other test suites I have used. CLI would be an important step here, as basic tests do not provide the coverage needed for a production build IMHO.

Lastly, community documentation was very difficult to follow for someone moving into the clojure community. I have found that the community is very wide, but great examples and real world documentation was challenging for the current clojure codebase.

### What I would do in the future
The amount of features to be added could be very interesting. Accessing your location via the browser would be cool, digging deeper into the API to show a deeper view of the current election, polling place finders, maps with geo coordinates and information, district information - the list goes on and on.

However, I have a tendency to give the basic information and focus on the UI at hand - search for an election and do it well, and show more concise information.

Lastly, language translations and ADA compliance is great. Give this to as many people as possible and stay compliant with state and local election laws.
